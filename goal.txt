The goal of this project in the end:


Server Commands:
ls - Lists all clients
lsteam - Lists all clients with a yes or no to connection
sel - List teams then list clients from each team to connect to
service - List all services


Service Shell: (Take in service)
ls - List all breaks and their purpose for the service
sel - Select a break to send (confirm before sending)
shell - Provides a shell that sends 
clients - lists clients that are currently connected



client shell
end - ends current connection 

main shell
reset - removes shell which removes IP from list and closes socket

NEED TO ADD:
1. Service shell
2. Custom breaks (open webserver on /, open webshell, stop service, etc.)
3. Add hostname to LS team and can tell if the service is up or not
4. Fix persistence
5. Fix keylogger 


Fix keylogger to always log in a file at /var/notkeylogging.txt

#detect os, if its freebsd do ifconfig (uname -e)
else do ip a

uname -n gives hostname


allow client to send to all clients on host
